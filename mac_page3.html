    <h4>1.) Blue Slide Park</h4>
            <p>
Mac takes you to his home 
town in Pitsburg to Blue slide 
Park where he discusses his 
come up and feelings 
associated with it in party 
anthem form with a nostalgic 
sound.

     <h4>2.) Macadelic</h4>
        <p>
Although a mixtape, Mac
shows more creativity than 
ever previously. Influenced
by the Beatles with deeper
philsophical questioning
makes for a trippier body
of work.

<h4>3.) Watching Movies with the Sound Off</h4>
<p>
Here we hear the biggest 
change in artistic direction.
Mac gets into his darker side, 
facing mental illness and 
drug abuse. We navigate 
through Mac’s dark thoughts 
that consume him on the daily. 
The instrumentals accent 
the mood with an atmosphereic
and psychedelic tone. The 
album is meant to be played 
over a muted movie so that 
the songs change the meaning 
of the movie.

    <h4>4.) Faces</h4>
<p>
Faces is a different approach 
to the “dark side of his bizzar 
mind”. 24 songs that take you 
on a journey through a drug 
addicts mind.This tape 
showcases some of Mac’s
best production and lyricism.
        </p></div>
            <div class="co5">
    <h4>5.) GOOD AM</h4>
<p>
Signed to a new label, Mac
takes us on a more positive
route. A mainstream
approach is taken and quickly
became Mac’s most favored
album to the average listener.

     <h4>6.) The Divine Feminine</h4>
<p>
An Album entirely focused on 
love. Smooth, jazzy 
instrumentals emote a strong 
feeling to help showcase how that feels.

<h4>7.) Swimming</h4>
<p>
The last album to come from
the artist balances depression
and optimism.He starts by 
looking for a way out of his 
head and ends with “so it 
goes”, a phrase used by Kurt 
Vonnegut every time a death 
occurs. Overall this album is 
truly beautiful and things feel 
clear for the first time.
